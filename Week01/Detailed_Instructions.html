            To make teriyaki chicken, start by preparing the teriyaki sauce. In a small bowl, combine 1/4 cup of 
            soy sauce, 1/4 cup of mirin (sweet rice wine), and 2 tablespoons of sugar. For extra flavor, you can
            add 1 teaspoon of grated ginger and 1 clove of minced garlic. Whisk the ingredients together until 
            the sugar dissolves, then set the sauce aside. Next, heat a tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large 
            skillet over medium heat. Pat 4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts dry with paper towels 
            to help them brown evenly, then add them to the pan. Cook for about 5-7 minutes on each side, or 
            until the chicken is golden brown and nearly cooked through. Once the chicken is browned, pour the 
            prepared teriyaki sauce into the pan. Reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer, occasionally 
            flipping the chicken to coat it evenly. Cook until the sauce thickens and becomes a glossy glaze, 
            about 5-10 minutes. Remove the chicken from the pan and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing. 
            Serve the teriyaki chicken over steamed rice, and garnish with sesame seeds and chopped green onions 
            for a delicious finish.

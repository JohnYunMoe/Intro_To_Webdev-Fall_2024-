Wireframing is more than just making a rough draft of what the final site/page is going to look like. There are many other aspects to wireframing that make it especially useful in the development phase of a webapp/website. This is more prevalent when it comes to working with others, e.g working with clients in a company. During the wireframing process, the client is able to see just how their website is going to funciton and because it is in such an early phase of development, the client is able to make as many changes as they would like without interrupting the workflow of the developer. Wireframing also ensures that there is a clear goal in mind.
